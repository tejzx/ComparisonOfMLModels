## 📊 Datasets Used
The project utilizes structured datasets suitable for classification and regression tasks. These datasets include features and labels for training and evaluating models.

## 🔍 Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling (Standardization/Normalization)
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Compared
The following models were trained and evaluated:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**
- **Neural Networks (Optional)**

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- **Classification Tasks:**
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - ROC-AUC Score
- **Regression Tasks:**
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score

## 📌 How to Use
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook ComparisonOfModels.ipynb
```
Train and evaluate models using `src/model_comparison.py`.
